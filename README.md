In modern-times, owing to hectic schedules it becomes very difficult to remain active all
the time. Imagine a situation where a person is driving home from work, dead tired after
facing all the challenges of the day. His hands are on the wheel and foot on the pedal but
suddenly he starts feeling sleepy, his eyes start shutting and his vision blurs and before he
knows it, he’s asleep.             
We usually come across drink and driving cases where drunk drivers crash their cars
under the influence of alcohol causing damage to property and life. So here we propose
an innovative system to eliminate such cases. Our proposed system would be constantly
monitoring the driver breath by placing it on the driver wheel or somewhere the driver’s
breath can be constantly monitored by it. So, if a driver is drunk and tries to drive the
system detects alcohol presence in his/her breath and locks the engine so that the vehicle
fails to start.
